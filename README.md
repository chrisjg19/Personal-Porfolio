## User Story

Hello Welcome to my Portfolio. I created this as my homework assignement where I had to showcase my knowlege of HTML and CSS  I have learned so far.
It defintely still lacks many feature and overall needs face lift, its an ever work in progress. But I hope that you still see that the main criteria, where as, the assignment was being 
graded on where hopefully met. The criteria I needed to meet is as follows
```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
